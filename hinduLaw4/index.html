  <p id="HMA"><strong>The Hindu Marriage Act is an Act of the Parliament of India enacted in 1955 which was passed on 18th of May.<br>The main purpose of the act was to amend and codify the law relating to marriage among Hindus and others. Besides amending and codifying Sastrik Law, it also included separation and divorce, which also exist in Sastrik Law. This enactment brought uniformity of law for all sections of Hindus. In India there are religion-specific civil codes that separately govern adherents of certain other religions.<br> Read More About It Below:</strong></p>

                      she was living apart and that since the passing of such
                      decree or order, cohabitation between the parties has
                      not been resumed for one year or upwards; (iv) that her
